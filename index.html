                <h2>Welcome to Our Project Website</h2>
                <p>
                    This website presents the findings of our service-learning project conducted by students of 
                    Bishop Heber College, Tiruchirappalli, India, in March 2025. The project, titled 
                    <b>"Survey on Free Food Providers in Government Hospitals and in Society,"</b> aimed to evaluate the 
                    impact, availability, quality, and challenges of free food services provided in government hospitals 
                    and communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our objectives were to identify food providers, assess their impact on beneficiaries such as patients, 
                    their families, and low-income individuals, evaluate the nutritional quality and accessibility of the 
                    food offered, and recommend actionable improvements to enhance these vital services. We sought to 
                    understand how these initiatives address food insecurity, support healthcare outcomes, and uplift 
                    vulnerable populations in both hospital settings and broader societal contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this website, we share our detailed methodology, key findings, and practical recommendations, 
                    hoping to raise awareness about the critical role of free food services in promoting well-being and 
                    social equity. Our research highlights the strengths of existing programs, uncovers gaps in service 
                    delivery, and proposes strategies to ensure that nutritious meals reach those who need them most. 
                    By shedding light on these efforts, we aspire to inspire collaboration among stakeholders—government 
                    bodies, NGOs, healthcare institutions, and local communities—to strengthen and sustain these essential 
                    services for the benefit of all.

                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    The project was conducted under the guidance of Dr. G. Sobers Smiles David from the Department of 
                    Computer Science at Bishop Heber College. It used a descriptive survey design, targeting patients, 
                    hospital staff, and visitors in government hospitals.Data was gathered through questionnaires, interviews, and observations, with stratified random sampling for fair representation

                <h2> Challenges & Recommendations</h2>
                <p>
                    Impact: Free food services significantly improve health and nutrition, reduce financial burdens, and enhance the well-being and dignity of recipients. They also support emotional well-being, as noted by students who distributed hygiene kits and observed improved patient morale. These programs foster a sense of community support, helping patients and families cope with stress and uncertainty during medical treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges: These include high operational costs, poor infrastructure, logistical issues (e.g., storage and distribution), nutritional deficits, and administrative hurdles. Fieldwork highlighted the need for better funding, logistics, and awareness to address these challenges. Additional barriers include inconsistent supply of raw materials, lack of trained staff, and limited coordination between providers and hospitals, underscoring the urgency for streamlined processes and increased stakeholder collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recommendations: To improve these services, we suggest better funding, efficient food distribution methods, and partnerships with NGOs. Government initiatives should be expanded to ensure every patient has access to nutritious food. Additionally, we propose regular quality checks to maintain nutritional standards, training for staff to enhance service delivery, and awareness campaigns to inform beneficiaries about available programs, maximizing their reach and impact.
